# Movie-Rental-App
Created an application using Java, with JavaFX serving as the graphical user interface, that lets users rent movies. Administrators are given access to customers' database where they can view and edit customer information in addition to updating and tracking rental inventories.

The movie and customer objects were created using OOP, and the state design pattern was used to modify a customer's member status (Premium member or General member).
